      "Not designed in the original scaffold; added as a 4-step wizard in feat/onboarding-wizard.",
    verdict: "strong",
    answer:
      "Invite-only, two doors: an ACAPS circle code or a single-use peer vouch from a verified member (3 per season, so vouching is a scarce, accountable act). Four steps, ~2 minutes: invitation → what you know (declaration decides who we ask, never your weight) → visibility with a live ‘what each audience sees’ preview → rhythm (weekly cap). Sensitive contexts pre-select Sealed. The first ask arrives immediately, so the first minute is a contribution, not a form.",

    verdict: "strong",
    answer:
      "Expertise is earned from four independent evidence streams, never self-declared: (a) one-time moderator verification, evidence then deleted; (b) vouches from verified peers; (c) resolved track record per theme (Brier skill, shrunk toward a floor with few results); (d) peer-rated usefulness (‘added new information’, ‘changed my mind’). Tiers: Invited → Verified → Established → Proven. Weighting uses only the track record, so credentials open the door and accuracy decides the voice.",

    verdict: "strong",
    answer:
      "Stickiness comes from closing loops, not from points. (1) Impact receipts: when your dissent is routed, actioned and acted on, you hear about it — even if Sealed, via your own inbox. (2) Resolution receipts: when a question resolves you privately see you vs circle vs ACAPS. (3) A calibration mirror, a thing experts can't get anywhere else. (4) Craft badges for quality (Well calibrated, Dissent vindicated, Mind-changer, Source scout) with no streaks to lose and no public rank. (5) Give-to-get: the full analysis, timeline, and Roundtable unlock per risk once you've contributed. (6) 6-month seasons + 14-day signal checks with ≤ 2 asks/week.",

    verdict: "strong",
    answer:
      "You don't have to ban them — you make them irrelevant. Newcomers start at a floor weight; only resolved accuracy raises it. On top, behavioural signals flag low-information patterns: fence-sitting (always ~50%), echoing ACAPS (≤ 6 pts from the rating), speeding (< 9 s), thin reasoning, and lock-step coordination pairs. These feed a ‘signal quality’ score shown to the expert first (mirror, not accusation) and to moderators.",

Identity leaves the database through a single function with a per-viewer allowlist; the public always gets ‘Anonymous expert’ and aggregates only when n ≥ 10.

    answer:
      "Order matters. Round 1 is blind: no ACAPS rating, no circle, no timeline. After you lock in, if you're ≥ 25 pts from ACAPS a neutral ‘second look’ appears: ACAPS' reasoning and sources, plus reasons given for higher AND for lower probabilities — same layout whichever direction you lean. ‘Keep my estimate’ and ‘Revise’ are equal buttons. The first estimate is stored immutably and scored; the revision is scored separately.",

      "A relevance score (country 60 + region 22 + theme 25 + ‘circle needs views’ 10) against the expert's own declared domain and their own threshold, plus their own weekly cap (1–3). Below threshold or over cap → not pushed, recorded as suppressed and shown on their ‘radar’ with the reason. Moderators get a Dispatch Lab dry-run with integrated risk timeline preview.",

    verdict: "strong",
    answer:
      "No system can read motive — and claiming so would itself be a trust failure. What works is detecting patterns that motivation leaves behind and bounding their influence: directional bias against resolved outcomes, extremity without evidence, loaded/absolute language, self-declared conflict-of-interest, and coordinated clusters. Output is a ‘review’ signal for a human moderator, never an auto-ban.",

      "The Roundtable per risk: structured posts (Claim, Evidence, Counter-view, Question, Missing risk/trigger), threaded, each with its own identity choice (profile level or more private). It unlocks only after you give your own estimate, protecting independence. Reactions reward epistemic value — ‘Added new information’, ‘Changed my mind’, ‘Needs a source’, ‘I see it differently’.",

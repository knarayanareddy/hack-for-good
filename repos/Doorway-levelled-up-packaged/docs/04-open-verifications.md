# Open verifications

*Every claim in the Doorway materials that is not yet sourced from a document I have read. Each has the exact question to ask and who can answer it. Nothing here should ship as fact until it moves to "closed."*

**Rule: any confidentiality claim in shipped copy must cite a source named in this file, or it does not render.**

## Blocking — must close before any copy ships

### V1 · Dutch confidentiality: what Offlimits actually promises

**The claim.** The organisers' `data/legal-confidentiality.json` block `confidentiality-nl-1` asserts that nothing is reported to police or justice. I have not verified this.

**Why it matters.** The brief lists *"be honest about … what is confidential"* as a **Should**, and explicitly warns that fear of being reported keeps people from seeking help. This is the single line most likely to be challenged by a juror from the sector, and getting it wrong would be worse than saying nothing.

**Ask:** Emma Persson (UNICRI, on site) or the Offlimits prevention line directly. Precisely: *under what circumstances does the preventielijn share information with police or justice, and how is that stated to a caller?*

**Status:** open · blocker

### V2 · Whether the prevention line serves English

**The claim.** The routes table sends non-Dutch browsers to ReDirection and Stop It Now UK rather than to Offlimits in English.

**Why it matters.** If Offlimits does serve English, Dutch forums route their English members away from the nearest and best service for no reason.

**Ask:** same contact. *Do you take contacts in English?*

**Status:** open · blocker

## High — affects a claim we want to make

### V3 · What the 4.5% redirect figure counts

**The claim.** Nurmi et al. (2026, SSRN preprint) report that 4.5% of search sessions redirected users to therapy resources.

**The ambiguity.** A click-through rate, or an automatic redirect? These are different numbers and only one is comparable to Ó Ciardha's 12.44%, which is a share of warnings *triggered*.

**Ask:** Dr Juha Nurmi, mentor, at the Discord Q&A or in person.

**Status:** open · high

### V4 · Whether the 2018→2024 decline is real or definitional

**The claim.** CSAM search volume on Ahmia fell from 27.2% in 2018 to 6.0% in 2024.

**The ambiguity.** The filter was expanded in November 2023 to block all sexual queries, and the denominator changed. The decline may be partly arithmetic.

**Ask:** Nurmi. *Does the decline survive controlling for the filter expansions and the change in total query volume?*

**Status:** open · high

### V5 · The Ahmia click-through confound

**The claim.** Platform CTR rose from 8.73% to 15.67% when redesigned messages launched.

**The ambiguity.** The interface was redesigned at the same time — several stacked panels consolidated into one page. The paper concedes this and reports the neutral control message at 12.17%, well above the 8.73% baseline. **The defensible claim is the within-campaign randomised comparison, not the before-and-after.**

**Ask:** Nurmi. *How much of the lift do you attribute to the layout change?*

**Status:** open · high · **affects how we describe the 700× finding**

## Medium — affects a supporting detail

### V6 · The Crime and Policing Act 2026 guidance

**The claim.** England created a reporting duty for people in regulated activity with children; guidance is pending. The organisers' own file flags this `[VERIFY]`.

**Why it matters.** It is the contrast case in the confidentiality story — Germany protects, England is moving the other way. If the guidance has landed, the contrast is sharper.

**Status:** open · medium

### V7 · Whether ReDirection and Kein Täter werden are correctly flagged `verified: false`

Both appear live and functioning in the repo's `help-services.json`, so the flag may be stale. If it is, a route we ship may be flagged for no reason.

**Status:** open · medium

### V8 · Current Offlimits capacity

**The figure I have.** 943 contacts in 2022, ~2.6 per day for 17.9 million people.

**What I need.** Current monthly volume and their own view of growth headroom. A product that succeeds breaks this service, and the pitch should carry their number rather than mine.

**Ask:** Offlimits, or Emma Persson.

**Status:** open · medium

## Low — worth knowing, not worth blocking

### V9 · UNICRI's preferred licence and hosting for anything going on the hub

MIT is in the repo. A UN platform may have its own requirements. Ask before claiming the artifact is reusable.

### V10 · How the check-safety tooling treats a modified contract

The kit ships `tools/check-safety.js` and a seven-schema contract. Removing `sessionScopedId` — which we do deliberately — may fail its own validation. **Test this early; if it fails, document the departure rather than patching around it silently.**

### V11 · The exact semantics of the `timeout` outcome

Whether a user who closes the tab is distinguishable from one who navigates away. This affects whether the arrival numbers are honest.
